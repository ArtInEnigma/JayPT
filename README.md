# JayPT
The goal of **JayPT** is to bring the convenience and natural feel of conversing with a human to the world of artificial intelligence. By using speech recognition and text-to-speech technology, this Google Chrome extension allows users to communicate with ChatGPT through their voice rather than just by typing. The resulting conversation feels more lifelike and can be useful in a variety of settings where a more human-like interaction with an AI is desired. Our team is dedicated to turning ChatGPT into a virtual assistant similar to the fictional character Jarvis, and we welcome any contributions that will help us achieve this goal.
